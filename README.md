# ATHENA

ATHENA agent-based software archaeology meets modular composition.

## Required Runtime Stack

- `picoclaw` + `zeptoclaw` for low-RAM operation on Bluefin/Podman targets.
- `RedPlanet Core` for persistent memory/context.
- `OpenCode + oh-my-opencode` for autonomous CEO command execution.
- Main operational folder: `~/Numenor_prime` on main PC.
- Discord as CEO control interface.

## Repository Map

- Core orchestrator: `athena.py`
- Olympian divisions: `apollo.py`, `ares.py`, `artemis.py`
- Recon and integration: `github_scout.py`, `code_integrator.py`
- Runtime interfaces: `discord_bot_fixed.py`, `citadel_pod_coordinator.py`
- Demos: `demo_integration.py`, `full_system_demo.py`
- Deployment/config: `requirements.txt`, `plutus-pod-containerfile`
- Docs: `docs/` (organized by architecture/setup/integration/operations)

Start with `docs/LAY_OF_LAND.md` for the analysis sequence.
For setup, use `docs/setup/INSTALL_CLEAR_BLUEFIN.md` as the source of truth.
Track execution status in `docs/notes/ATHENA_PROGRESS.md`.
